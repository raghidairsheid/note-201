       <h4>Space of the moon</h4>
       <p id ="c1">The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized
            planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon.</p>

       <h4>Intergalactic space</h4>
       <p id = "c2">The space between stars is known as interstellar space, 
           and so the space between galaxies is called intergalactic space. 
           These are the vast empty spaces that sit between galaxies. For example, 
           if you wanted to travel from the Milky Way to the Andromeda galaxy, you would 
           need to cross 2.5 million light-years of intergalactic space.</p>
